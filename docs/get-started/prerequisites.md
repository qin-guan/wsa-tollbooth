# Prerequisites

Before you can impress your soulmate with your amazing app, you need the following:

* A database provider of your choice
* A deployment provider of your choice
* A Resend account

## Database

Anything goes, as long as it's supported by [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/database-reference/database-features)

:::tip Not sure what to use?

`@opengovsg/starter-kit` recommends [CockroachDB](https://start.open.gov.sg/docs/getting-started/prerequisites#cockroachdb), which is really good!

:::

## Deployment

Anything goes, as long as it's a supported **Worker** platform by [Nitro](https://nitro.unjs.io/deploy/workers), and supports TCP connections.

`@opengovsg/starter-kit` recommends [Vercel](https://start.open.gov.sg/docs/getting-started/prerequisites#vercel), which is really good!

## Resend

Unfortunately, I don't have access to [Postman](https://start.open.gov.sg/docs/getting-started/prerequisites#postman-api), and SendGrid doesn't like me, so Resend is the only option.
